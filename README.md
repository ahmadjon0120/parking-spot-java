PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
To develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on the functions implemented in the previous console-based version. The system provides a clear representation of parking slots, allowing users to search, add, or delete slots and cars. Advanced features include displaying parking times, tracking elapsed time, and managing cars directly within the slots. This project demonstrates comprehension of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles while incorporating design elements to enhance visual hierarchy and usability.
